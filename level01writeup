## Writeup
Browsed through the files and found a bunch of level files in /levels as well as a bunch of level directories in $home

the first level file level01 has a .sqlite file so I opened it with `sqlite3 <database name>`, and `.dump`ed the contents, seeing there's a password table I just ran SELECT * FROM passwords and got id: rator and password: Administ

then after running `./level01` it asked me to enter the password, Administ, and allowed me to visit `~/../level02/ && cat .pass`
